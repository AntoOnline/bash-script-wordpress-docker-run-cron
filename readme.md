# WordPress Cron Runner

This script is designed to run the WordPress cron (`wp-cron.php`) for all running Docker containers with a WordPress instance.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Bash

## Usage

1. Make sure the `wordpress-docker-run-cron.sh` script is executable:

```
chmod +x wordpress-docker-run-cron.sh
```

2. Run the script:

```
./wordpress-docker-run-cron.sh
```

The script will identify all running Docker containers with a WordPress instance, and then execute the `wp-cron.php` file for each of them.

## How it works

The script performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves the container names of all running WordPress instances.
2. Iterates through the container names and runs the `wp-cron.php` file for each instance.

The script will output the container names of the running WordPress instances and display a message indicating that the cron has been run for each instance. After completing the process for all instances, the script will display a message indicating that all WordPress instances have run the cron.
